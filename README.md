# Image-Colorization

Automatic colorization of gray-scale images using deep learning and OpenCV is a technique to colorize gray-scale images without involvement of a human. Conventional techniques used for colorizing images need human intervention.The proposed technique uses deep convolutional neural networks and has a number of advantages. The technique will reduce manual work, speed up the process and improve the accuracy.
